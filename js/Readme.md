# Javascript

This folder contains JavaScript files for the game. Each file handles one class of objects and how they are handled by the game controller, defined in controller.js. The game controller continually updates the canvas to display the game and handles polling as well. The controller creates a set number of each type of object to display on the canvas as well.
